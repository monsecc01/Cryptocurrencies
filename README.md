## Overview

The purpose of the Cryptocurrencies analysis is to create a report that shows cryptocurrencies in the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for a new investment.

We will create the report by using python to preprocess data, reduce data, create a cluster algorithm, and vizualize our findings.
